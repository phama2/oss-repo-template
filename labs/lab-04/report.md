### Why is it important to choose a license?
Choosing a license is crucial because it determines if a piece of code is categorized as free or non-free, with both sides having its own caveats. The chosen license would specify restrictions and limitations of the software along with other guidelines, such as rules about packaging and distribution of the software. Software licenses are significant in the fact that they define exactly how a user can access, use, and modify existing software for their own needs and purposes.
### Why is it important that you shouldn't use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
Most software licenses are baed on copyright, with limits on the kinds of requirements that can be imposed. If a project does not have an explicit license, using it could lead to potential legal troubles and liability due to not having obvious permission to reuse or modify the existing project. Additionally, to obtain permission, you would have to directly reach out to the developer or team of developers to ask to modify or use the code, something which they could revoke later due to no explicit license outlining guidelines on how use or modify the existing software.
