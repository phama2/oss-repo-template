## 2. Reading Assignment
`Open Source Definition` \
The Open Source Definition has ten major criteria that must be followed for software to be categorized as open source. These criteria seems to allow software to be analyzed to ensure whether it is open source or not. Perhaps before these standards were established, software could be labeled open source without it actually being or vice-versa. These standards clearly clarify what criteria some software has to meet before being designated as open source.

`How To Answer Questions in a Helpful Way`
* Sometimes, if there isn't a relevant post answering your question, try rewording it or searching for an exact match (using quotations in google) for specific keyword to help find what you're looking for.
* If you do find a relevant post on Stack Overflow, there may be similar questions on the sidebar that may help you understand similar problems which could in turn further your understanding of the initial solution.

`Free Culture`
* Jesse was a curious student who developed his own search engine. However, even though this creation entirely based on curiousity, he was dealt an undeserving punishment for something that was not caused by him. Due to others putting music in their public folders, which his search engine had access to, he was served a lawsuit even though he had no control over what was put in the folders. What started as a passion project ended in the worst way possible. He was forced to essentially give away his money off of some software he wrote for fun. This shows the dreadful reality some developers go through just trying to make something based on passion or curiosity. While making no profit, some larger entities may attack them just for even incorporating any snippet of their content, whether intentionally or unintentionally. With seemingly no morality, these entities will relentlessly pursue someone until they acquiesce to their demands. It seems to me that developers need to be conscientious when creating software that someone else could call infringement upon, even unintentionally.
