## 2. Reading Assignment
`Open Source Definition` \
The Open Source Definition has ten major criteria that must be followed for software to be categorized as open source. Most of these categories seem pretty self-explanatory and obvious when one is thinking about what open-source actually means. These criteria seems to allow software to be analyzed to ensure whether it is open source or not. Perhaps before these standards were established, software could be labeled open source without it actually being or vice-versa. These standards clearly clarify what criteria some software has to meet before being designated as open source.

`How To Answer Questions in a Helpful Way`
* Sometimes, if there isn't a relevant post answering your question, try rewording it or searching for an exact match (using quotations in google) for specific keyword to help find what you're looking for.
* If you do find a relevant post on Stack Overflow, there may be similar questions on the sidebar that may help you understand similar problems which could in turn further your understanding of the initial solution.

`Free Culture`
* Jesse was a curious student who developed his own search engine using freely available open-source code. However, even though this creation entirely based on curiousity, he was dealt an undeserving punishment for something that was not caused by him. Due to others putting music in their public folders, which his search engine had access to, he was served a lawsuit even though he had no control over what was put in the folders. What started as a passion project ended in the worst way possible. He was forced to essentially give away his money off of some software he wrote for fun. This shows the dreadful reality some developers go through just trying to make something based on passion or curiosity. While making no profit, some larger entities may attack them just for even incorporating any snippet of their content, whether intentionally or unintentionally. With seemingly no morality, these entities will relentlessly pursue someone until they acquiesce to their demands. It seems to me that developers need to be conscientious when creating software that someone else could call infringement upon, even unintentionally.

## 6. Reflection
One open source project that I found pretty interesting while browsing through the trending projects is Omni (https://github.com/alyssaxuu/omni). It is an open-source chrome extension written in javascript (using jQuery) that allows for more versatility while using chrome, allowing for increased productivity. From what I can tell from looking at the front page's readme is that it adds specific commands to chrome through a mac-like terminal style which can be accessed through a shortcut. Rather than having to dig through various shortcuts or nested menus with the current chrome graphical interface, it allows for inputting of direct commands through a commandline. Examples of this are /bookmark and /history, both pretty self-explanatory commands that allows the user to directly access what they want without navigating through graphical menus. It's interesting because this allows for users who prefer commandline (such as many linux users) over GUIs to use chrome in a way that could be more comfortable to them. This is a useful utility that brings adds additional functionality to the chrome browser for users who prefer commandline.
